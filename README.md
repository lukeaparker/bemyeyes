What is your elevator pitch for your API?
E.g. I want to write an API that catalogues all of the books I’ve read. Others can add books they’ve read, so that we can cross-reference our reading lists.






What resources does your API have? What fields do the resources have?
E.g. Book with fields title, num_pages, publish_date, genre, author, favorited_by; 
Author with fields name, birth_date, books






What is the relationship between your resources?
E.g. Author has many Books (one-to-many), Book can be favorited by many Users (many-to-many)






What routes does your API have that can be used to access the data? What kind of data does each route return?
E.g. /authors, /author/1, /author/1/books, /author/1/books/2







What challenges might you have with implementing this API?
